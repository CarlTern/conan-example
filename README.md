# Scanning Conana (C/C++) with Debricked

### Note:

As of September 2024, C and C++ are not supported by Debricked. It is currently in active development and this workaround may become outdated after the official release.

Please check out https://docs.debricked.com/overview/language-support for the most up-to-date information.

### The workaround 

The idea is that there are tools to generate SBOM's for conan, and Debricked can scan SBOM's. Please check out the github action in this repo for more details.
